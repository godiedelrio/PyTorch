    "As it is said in this [IBM article](https://www.ibm.com/topics/convolutional-neural-networks), neural networks are a subset of machine learning, and they are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. They are comprised of node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold, as it is shown below.\n",

    "The idea of such a mechanism is to try to model the real behavior of a biological neuron. The biological neuron takes information sent from other neurons through the dendrites, it is processed by the nucleus of the neuron and it is sent away by the axon. To model this biological mechanism, computer scientists have developed the perceptron, which aims to take data from other neurons through its *weights*, process it with a *linear function*, and 'fire' that information based on the output of the *activation function*.\n",

    "While working with image, speech, or audio signal inputs, *convolutional neural networks* are distinguished from other neural networks by their superior performance. They have three main types of layers, which are:\n",
    "- Convolutional layer\n",
    "- Pooling layer\n",
    "- Fully-connected (FC) layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The *convolutional layer* is the first layer of a convolutional network. While convolutional layers can be followed by additional convolutional layers or *pooling layers*, the *fully-connected* layer is the final layer. With each layer, the CNN increases in its complexity, identifying greater portions of the image. Earlier layers focus on simple features, such as colors and edges. As the image data progresses through the layers of the CNN, it starts to recognize larger elements or shapes of the object until it finally identifies the intended object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Convolutional layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolutional layer is the core building block of a CNN, and it is where the majority of computation occurs. It requires a few components, which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input data**: Since in this projects we are going to work with clothes images, let’s assume that the input will be a grey color image. It is made up of a matrix of pixels, which means that the input will have two dimensions, a height and width. Since the images are in greyscale, they have just one *channel*. For RGB images, the number of channels is 3.\n",
    "- **Filter**: It is the set of feature detectors, composed of various *kernels*, which will move across the *receptive fields* of the image, checking if the feature is present. This process is known as a *convolution*. The kernel is a two-dimensional (2-D) array of weights, which represents part of the image. They can vary in size, which determines the size of the receptive field. The kernel is then applied to an area of the image, and a dot product is calculated between the input pixels and the kernel. This dot product is then fed into an output array. Afterwards, the kernel shifts by a *stride*, repeating the process until the kernel has swept across the entire image. There will be one kernel per input channel of the convolutional layer and one filter per output channel.\n",
    "- **Feature map**: The final output from the series of dot products from the input and the filter is known as a feature map, activation map, or a convolved feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each convolution operation, a CNN applies an *activation function* transformation to the feature map, introducing nonlinearity to the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned earlier, another convolution layer can follow the initial convolution layer. When this happens, the structure of the CNN can become hierarchical as the later layers can see the pixels within the receptive fields of prior layers.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Pooling layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling layers, also known as downsampling, conducts dimensionality reduction, reducing the number of parameters in the input. Its purpose is to gradually shrink the representation’s spatial dimension. Similar to the convolutional layer, the pooling operation sweeps a filter across the entire input, but the difference is that this filter does not have any weights. Instead, the kernel applies an aggregation function to the values within the receptive field, populating the output array. There are two main types of pooling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Max pooling**: As the filter moves across the input, it selects the pixel with the maximum value to send to the output array. As an aside, this approach tends to be used more often compared to average pooling.\n",
    "- **Average pooling**: As the filter moves across the input, it calculates the average value within the receptive field to send to the output array.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a title=\"Rafay Qayyum - Introduction To Pooling Layers In CNN\" href=\"https://pub.towardsai.net/introduction-to-pooling-layers-in-cnn-dafe61eabe34\"><img width=\"512\" alt=\"Introduction To Pooling Layers In CNN\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/1*fXxDBsJ96FKEtMOa9vNgjA.gif\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "While a lot of information is lost in the pooling layer, it also has a number of benefits to the CNN. They help to reduce complexity, improve efficiency, and limit risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final comment, after each kernel is applied in each input channel, the output maps are combined to give as a result one feature map. Thus, as said above, the number of filters will determine the number of output channels in a convolutional layer.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Fully-connected layer\n",
    "\n",
    "They are the layers that do not use as inputs 2D or 3D arrays of data, performing a convolution, but take 1D arrays of data and apply to them a linear transformation. They are composed of the perceptrons defined above and their objective is to produce the final output of the entire network.\n",
